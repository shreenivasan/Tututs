Datatypes supported by Redis:

    A)  String: 
                Similar to Strings in PHP.
    B)  List: 
                Similar to a single dimensional array in PHP. 
                You can push, pop, shift and unshift, the elements that are placed in order or insertion FIFO (first in, first out).

    C)  Hash:   Maps between string fields and string values. 
                They are the perfect data type to represent objects 
                (e.g.: A User with a number of fields like name, surname, and so forth).

    D)  Set:    Similar to list, except that it has no order and each element may appear only once.

    E)  Sorted Set: Similar to Redis Sets with a unique feature of values stored in set. The difference is that each member of a Sorted Set is associated with score, used to order the set from the smallest score to the largest.
